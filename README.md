     - Finds and counts the number of services that have been started and stopped on the system.
     - Identifies all passwords on the system and checks them for simplicity (a basic security measure).

### **Add Some Animations to Your Process!**

While working on this challenge, hereâ€™s how you can enhance the user experience with animations:

- Use terminal animation tools like `figlet`, `cowsay`, or `lolcat` for fun outputs and visual feedback during script execution.
- Animate the progress of your tasks (counting services or checking passwords) with `pv` (Pipe Viewer) for a more interactive feel.

Example:

```bash
# Example of using progress bar animation in Bash:
echo "Starting script execution..."
echo -n "Counting started and stopped services... "
pv -n /dev/zero > /dev/null
echo "Done!"
